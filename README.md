# Simple CRUD API with FastAPI and PostgreSQL

## Description
This project is for educational purposes, and I plan to improve it over time. Currently, the API supports basic CRUD operations by accessing the endpoints. In the future, I will implement authentication, so that endpoints can only be accessed by logged-in users.

## Features
- Create
- Read
- Update
- Delete

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- FastAPI
- PostgreSQL
- Uvicorn

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/seu-usuario/seu-repositorio.git
   cd seu-repositorio
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
   venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

## Usage
Run the API using Uvicorn:
```sh
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
